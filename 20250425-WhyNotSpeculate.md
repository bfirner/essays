What are PE Ratios and Do They Matter?
--------------------------------------

I recently read Benjamin Graham's book, "The Intelligent Investor."
In the book, he points out that a lot of metrics used to value stocks have little inherent meaning.
It got me thinking about some "common wisdom" that goes flying around the internet, and made me want to dig more deeply into some details.

Specifically, I'll look at the PE ratio and what it means by looking at the stock of a well-known company.
Also, whenever I write "currently," I mean as of Friday, April 25, 2025. If I update this anything at a later point in time, I will note the new dates.

But first, a disclaimer!

Okay, now let's talk about the PE ratio: what is it, how is it used, and does it have any meaning?

The PE ratio is the ratio of a company's price per stock to its earnings per stock (which is just the net earnings divided by the number of shares).
Most companies only release earnings information four times a year, and the PE ratio takes the last four earnings statements to calculate PE over a year's worth of earnings.
Companies listed on U.S. exchanges have filings are available on the SEC's [https://www.sec.gov/search-filings](website).

Common knowledge says that buying something cheap is better than buying the same thing for more money, so we want to buy stocks that have a low price relative to their earnings.
Why?
Because we would like the company to pay us back for owning their shares.
If you purchase a stock with a crazy PE ratio of 1/1000, the company could theoretically compensate you for the entire cost of the share by distributing 1/1000 of their yearly earnings as a dividend.
A stock with a crazy PE ratio of 1000/1 would have to give all of its earnings to its shareholders every year for 1000 years to compensate you for the cost of a share.

So why do people buy high PE stocks?
The PE ratio is necessarily backwards looking (since we don't know future earnings yet), which is a problem.
For a stable company with constant growth, the current PE is a good predictor of the future PE; if the current PE is too high, then there is a good chance that the future PE will be too high as well.

But what about a new company?
What about Palantir (PLTR), which current closed with a share price of \$112.78 and a PE ratio of 596.40?

The company's revenues in the four quarters of 2024 were, in millions, \$634, \$678, \$725, and \$828.
As people on internet would say, "number go up."

PE ratios can get crazy when the future earnings of a company are expected to be much greater than past earnings.
Maybe the company is finally landing its first contracts, or perhaps it has finished paying for an expensive facility that will allow it to print money.
Whatever the case, the shareholders are expecting the earnings to go up like a rocket.

I can't see the future, so I can't say how the story with Palantir will play out, but we can look backwards at another stock: Cisco Systems, Inc.
There's a good chance that the words you are currently reading were transmitted over Cisco hardware, and people got really excited about the stock in the late 1990s when it became obvious that the Internet was going to be amazing.

Some notes:
* There were two 2:1 stock splits in 2000, and 3:2 stock splits in 1999, 1997, and 1996. The price should be adjusted for those.
* The EPS (earning per share) is the value taken after the quarterly report in November^[I looked up the quarterly reports on the SEC site, but digital records only go back to the mid 2000s, so I had to supplement with non-official sources.].
* Yearly Growth is the growth of the stock price.
* CAGR is Cumulative Average Growth Rate, or the average yearly rate of return. I've assumed that dividends are reinvested in the stock, but I've calculated them as reinvested on the last day of the year to simplify my calculations.

Taking a look at the annual growth rate, it's pretty good (at least up until today -- the stock price could fall off a cliff tomorrow for all we know).
The stock has gone through a few rough years, the worst one in 2001 with a drop of more than 50%. That didn't quite wipe out the gains when it jumped from \$7.19 to \$29.06 from 1998-2000, but if you bought in 1999 or 2000 you would be disappointed.
The 10-year treasury yields at the end of 1999 were 6.45%, so an investor who bought before 1999 would have been better of selling their stock, paying taxes on their gains, and investing the rest in federally tax-free treasuries.

So was the PE ratio a warning? Yes, sort of.

Notice that the PE ratio was high in 1999 when the EPS was twenty cents. The next year, the EPS jumped to \$1.10 and the PE fell to 26.42.
So, in fact, those who predicted the jump in earnings and bought or held through the high PE were not wrong.
The people who predicted that earnings would remain at the level made a mistake though, as they dropped to forty cents in the next year.
It wouldn't be until 2008 that they again rose above a dollar.

The real warning here is the PE ratios look backwards.
Sometimes that means they underestimate the performance of a company in the next year, such as Cisco going from 1999 to 2000.
Sometimes that means they overestimate the performance of a company, such as Cisco going from 2000 to 2001.

If I'm holding a high PE stock, even if I know that revenues will be going up I will still check to see if they are one time things, or real sustainable growth in earnings.
I'll also worry that company's business is too lucrative, and will attract strong competition that will pull market share away.
If I can't believe that the company has sustainable growth, then I would be better of selling it while it is high and replacing it with a less speculative investment.
