Short Story: The Soul of a Digital Artist
------------------------------------------

The artist sat in a coffee shop, searching for inspiration.
He enjoyed working as a professional artist, at least he did most of the time.
The flexible working hours, the freedom to work where he wanted...
It was certainly better than being chained to some desk.

He tapped his pencil against his empty notebook; he needed some inspiration.
The grabbed his latte and took a quick sip while glancing at the other patrons.
There were a few people in their computers, a couple of people in meetings stared dead-eyed at their
screens, and even a pair of friends reading old-fashioned paper books together.
None of them were quite right.

<!-- TODO use more words like "patron", that used to mean something special in the art world -->
<!-- Mention the barrista flirting while giving latte art to the customer. Have the artist deride
the latte "art" as he leaves (for its impermanence? Maybe -- his art will stick around) -->

A bright laugh caught his attention.
He turned his head to see the barrista flirting with a customer.
Perfect.

The artist sketched.
